Students produce three project documents during the term: two final reports at the end of each module, and then a final proposal. Within each module, students will participate in two teams (4-6 people each) in which they will work on program development within their team sub-topic. At the end of each module, the team will present their analysis and proposal to a panel of experts. The last few weeks of the course will be focused on polishing the proposals, identifying funding agencies as well as international organizations for program implementation. The last day of class will be the final presentations.

| PROJECT DOCUMENTS | DESCRIPTIONS |
| --- | --- |
| Final Reports | Each team should put together a report of 15-20 pages in length analyzing their subtopic, problems identified, solutions proposed and a detailed proposal for implementing their solutions. In-class presentations (with Microsoft® PowerPoint®) should be prepared of 20 minutes in length. More details to follow. |
| Final Proposal | Edited and final proposals will be submitted along with edited presentations given (presentations can be merged if applicable). More details to follow.
