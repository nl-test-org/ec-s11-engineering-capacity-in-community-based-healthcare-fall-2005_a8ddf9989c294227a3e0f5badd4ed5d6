| Homework 1 | Background Analysis: Students should submit a two-page background analysis on Zambia's healthcare, specifically analyzing ART access and efficacy care. Choose a particular piece of the HIV puzzle in Zambia, whether it be mother to child transmission, a specific diagnostic tool, pharmaceutical companies, WHO standard, etc. Pick 1 to 3 topics depending on the breadth of research you want to do. Have at least 4 references. There is no need to specify urban areas, or Lusaka at this point, but if you want to narrow it to this level, feel free to do so. These papers are meant to allow you to research your own interest in HIV/AIDS in Zambia and particularly ART access and efficacy. | Compiled Student Responses ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mitec_s11f05_hw1_papers)) |
